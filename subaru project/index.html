    <h1>Subaru</h1>
    <img src="all subarus.jpg" alt="all subarus" class="allsubarus">
    <p>Subaru (スバル) (/ˈsuːbəruː/ or /sʊˈbɑːruː/; Japanese pronunciation: [ˈsɯbaɾɯ] is the automobile manufacturing division of Japanese transportation conglomerate Subaru Corporation (formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries), the twenty-second largest automaker by production worldwide in 2012.[8]

        Subaru cars are known for their use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500 cc. The Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout was introduced in 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012 via a partnership with Toyota, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX, Legacy and Outback XT, Ascent, and previously the Legacy GT and Forester XT.
        
        In Western markets, the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers. Marketing is targeted towards specific niches centered on those who desire the company's signature drive train engine, all-wheel/rough-road capabilities or affordable sports car markets.[9]
        
        Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create</p>

    <img src="subaru ascent.jpg" alt="subaru ascent">
    <p>The Subaru Ascent is a mid-size crossover SUV made by Subaru. It is the largest automobile Subaru manufactures. The seven or eight-seat passenger SUV, with the design based on the VIZIV-7 concept, made its debut at the LA Auto Show on November 28, 2017. The Ascent became available in the third quarter of 2018.</p>

        <img src="subaru forester.jpg" alt="subaru Forester">
        <p>The Subaru Forester (Japanese: スバル•フォレスター Subaru Foresutā) is a compact crossover SUV (sport utility vehicle) that's been manufactured since 1997 by Subaru. Available in Japan from 1997, the Forester shares its platform with the Impreza. It has been awarded Motor Trend's 2009 and 2014 SUV of the Year and The Car Connection's Best Car To Buy 2014.</p>

            <h1>Subaru Brz</h1>
            <img src="subaru brz.jpg" alt="subaru brz">
            <p>The Toyota 86 is a 2+2 sports car jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, manufactured at Subaru's Gunma assembly plant along with a badge engineered variant, marketed as the Subaru BRZ.

                The 2+2 fastback coupé is noted for its naturally-aspirated boxer engine, front-engined, rear-wheel-drive configuration, 53/47 front/rear weight balance and low center of gravity — and for drawing inspiration from Toyota's earlier AE86, a small, light, front-engine/rear-drive Corolla variant widely popular for Showroom Stock, Group A, and Group N, Rally, Club and drift racing.
                
                Toyota markets the sports car as the 86 in Asia, Australia, North America (from August 2016), South Africa, and South America; as the Toyota GT86 in Europe; as the 86 and GT86 in New Zealand; as the Toyota FT86 in Nicaragua and Jamaica and as the Scion FR-S (2012-2016) in the United States and Canada.</p>

                <h1>Subaru Crosstrek</h1>
                <img src="subaru crosstrek.jpg" alt="subaru crosstrek">
                <p>The Subaru Crosstrek (known as the Subaru XV internationally) is a compact crossover built by Subaru as a successor to the Subaru Outback Sport in the United States and Canada, and the Subaru Impreza XV internationally. Like the Outback Sport, the Crosstrek is a lifted Subaru Impreza hatchback with minor differences, though with a more substantial lift than the Outback Sport. The Crosstrek has a variety of engine and trim options, depending on the market.</p>

                    <h1>Subaru Viziv</h1>
                    <img src="subaru viziv.jpg" alt="subaru viziv">
                    <p>The Subaru VIZIV is a series of hybrid concept sports SUVs designed and built by Subaru, the first of which was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The VIZIV series included several signature Subaru design features, such as the use of horizontally-opposed engines and all-wheel drive, and built on prior Subaru hybrid concepts such as the B9SC, B5-TPH, and Hybrid Tourer by using a three-motor layout. Since 2016, the VIZIV concept cars have previewed styling for upcoming production automobiles, and the hybrid powertrain has been dropped in favor of a conventional gasoline engine and all-wheel-drive.</p>

                        <h1>Subaru Outback</h1>
                        <img src="subaru outback.jpg" alt="subaru outback">
                        <p>The Outback station wagon originally derived from the station wagon variant of the Subaru Legacy. The first generation Legacy, which made its debut in 1989, did not receive the cosmetic and suspension modifications to create an Outback version, although Subaru offered an Outdoor option package for the 1994 model year Legacy L all-wheel drive model, which added an adjustable suspension, a luggage rack, a skidplate, and mud flaps.

                            Earlier, a raised-roof "Touring Wagon" variant had been offered on the preceding Subaru Leone for the 1988 and 1989 model years. Subaru also sold a raised-roof variant (chassis code BF) of the first generation Legacy wagon outside the United States. North American Legacy wagons were only offered as the flat-roof variant (chassis code BJ) until a special "GT" model was marketed for the 1994 model year.
                            
                            The second-generation Legacy wagon became the first generation of the Outback wagon series, called the Legacy Grand Wagon in Japan in 1995, and the "Legacy Outback" in most other markets. Compared to the existing Legacy wagon, the "Outback" variant added partial protective plastic side body cladding for off-road conditions, used a raised roof, and would later raise the suspension to provide additional ground clearance. It was introduced at the 1994 New York Auto Show. Aside from other small differences in trim, the Outback shares almost all of its components with the Legacy donor model.
                            
                            When launched in Australia in 1996 "Legacy Outback" was shortened simply to the "Outback", followed in other markets afterwards. In the United States, Subaru also retailed the Legacy SUS sedan between the 1997 and 2007 model years, with similar modifications to distinguish it from the equivalent Legacy model sedan. The Impreza Outback Sport was introduced at the 1996 New York Auto Show, but for the 1997 model year, the donor model names were dropped, and the cars were known as the "Outback" and "Outback Sport".</p>

                            <h1>Subaru Wrx</h1>
                            <img src="subaru wrx.jpg" alt="subaru wrx">
                            <p>The Subaru Impreza (Japanese: スバル・インプレッサ, Hepburn: Subaru Inpuressa) is a compact car that has been manufactured by Subaru since 1992. It was introduced as a replacement for the Leone, with the predecessor's EA series engines replaced by the new EJ series. It is now in its fifth generation.

                                Subaru has offered four-door sedan and five-door body variants since 1992. The firm also offered a coupe from 1995 until 2001, and a 5-door wagon from the Impreza's introduction in the form of a hatchback. Mainstream versions have received "boxer" flat-four engines ranging from 1.5- to 2.5-liters, with the performance-oriented Impreza WRX and WRX STI models uprated with the addition of turbochargers. Since the third generation series, some markets have adopted the abbreviated Subaru WRX name for these high-performance variants. The first three generations of Impreza were also available with an off-road appearance package called the Outback Sport, exclusive to the North American market. For the fourth generation, this appearance package was renamed the XV (Crosstrek in North America), and is sold internationally. Colloquially, the car is sometimes referred to as Scooby.
                                
                                The Impreza (also Impreza WRX and Impreza WRX STI) was a major rival to the Mitsubishi Lancer (and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution).
                                
                                Subaru has offered both front- and all-wheel drive layouts for the Impreza. Since the late-1990s, some markets have restricted sales to the all-wheel drive model—therefore granting the Impreza a unique selling proposition in the global compact class characterized by front-wheel drive. However, Japanese models remain available in either configuration.
                                
                                A 2019 iSeeCars study named the Impreza as the lowest-depreciating sedan after five years.
                                
                                The next-generation WRX and WRX STI is expected to be announced in 2020 or 2021.</p>

                    <h1>Subaru Legacy</h1>
                    <img src="subaru legacy.jpg" alt="subaru legacy">
                    <p>The Subaru Legacy (Japanese: スバル・レガシィ, Subaru Regashi) is a midsize car built by Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru since 1989. The maker's flagship car, it is unique in its class for offering all-wheel drive as a standard feature, and Subaru's traditional BOXER engine. The Legacy is sold as the Liberty in Australia out of deference to Legacy Australia, an organisation dedicated to caring for the families of military service veterans.

                        In 1996, a variant of the Legacy with heightened suspension called the Legacy Outback was introduced to compete in the burgeoning sport-utility vehicle class and proved to be a sales success for Subaru. The Outback line was split into its own model in 2000, known as the Subaru Outback.
                        
                        As of 2008, 3.6 million Legacy models have been built since its 1989 introduction.</p>
